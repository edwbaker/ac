## Phase of work:
The Views Task Group is a newly constituted task group under the Audubon Core Maintenance Group, tasked with developing controlled vocabularies for the Audubon Core terms `ac:subjectOrientation` and `ac:subjectPart`.  Its charter was submitted in June 2019 and a [revised version](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/views-tg-draft-charter-2019-06-25.pdf) has been resubmitted to the Executive Committee awaiting approval.

The current phase of work is the collection of use cases from the community.

## Activities:
Although the Task Group has not yet been officially approved, it has already held two online meetings to plan its work.  Although the meetings are open to the public, with one exception they have so far only been attended by the core members.  However, any interested members of the public can track the work of the task group by watching the [Audubon Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdwg/ac).

An important activity was creating a list of community organizations, individuals, and mailing lists that can be used to solicit use cases. See the [2019-08-12 meeting notes](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/historical/vcv-notes-2019-09-09.pdf) for the list.

## Accomplishments:
The Task Group has drafted [example use cases](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/use-case-examples.md) and created a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdR7fsy7DbdBT2jflQ-3NEbtYKYnO2Hq3x24RDxw3D0PbcYDQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) for submission of use cases. Core members have been contacting members of the community to solicit submissions. Submissions will be accepted until 2019-11-01.  

## Impediments to progress
None so far.

## Changes in goals or scope
There are no anticipated major changes in goals or scope.

## Plans for next calendar year
Following the gathering of use cases, the Task Group will use them to determine the requirements for the controlled vocabularies and assemble those requirements into a Feature Report as required in Section 4.2.1 of the [TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md).  We hope to complete that phase by the end of 2019.  The next phase will be to develop the actual controlled vocabularies as SKOS concept schemes.  That phase is scheduled to be completed by June 2020.  The final phase will be test implementation and collection of data on implementation experience to be assembled into an Implementation Experience Report.  If all goes well, this will be completed by the end of 2020 and the controlled vocabularies will be ready for submission.
