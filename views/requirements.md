# Requirements

## Subject part

1. Subject part values are grouped appropriately for broad categories of organisms (e.g. trees, quadrapeds, etc.). (1-CATEGORIZE-1)
1. Allows specification of multiple parts in an image and/or inference of subparts from a larger whole (2-FILTER-1)
2. Allows specification of whether entire part is visible in image (2-FILTER-2)
2. Associate appropriate subject parts with different insect life stages. (3-MEASURE-2)
3. Associate appropriate subject parts with different orders of insects. (3-MEASURE-3)
1. Subject Part is hierarchical to nest appropriate terms under specimen vs. not-specimen (e.g. label). There might be a better term in AC for this, in which case, please disregard this use case here! (4-ISLABEL-1)
1. Standardized image labels should indicate both the part of the plant photographed and, the view/orientation of the part (side view of the flower, top view etc.) (5-KEYS-1)
1. Links to trait ontologies would help standardize the labels, but the ontologies are not always accurate. There should be a way to take this into account. (6-ANATOMY-1)
2. The view should contain the section "angle:" cross, longitudinal, oblique, tangential, radial/medial. (6-ANATOMY-2)
1. Semantics must distinguish between similar parts (flower bud vs. leaf bud). (7-CLARITY-1)
2. Semantics must distinguish between aggregate parts. (7-CLARITY-2)
3. Semantics must distinguish between varying developmental stages. (7-CLARITY-3)
1. For some organism groups, viewing angles must be related to particular morphological features so that selection of that angle would make the feature visible. (8-ORIENT-1)

## Subject orientation

2. Subject orientations are grouped appropriately for subject parts. (1-CATEGORIZE-2)
3. Allows for description of orientations of live subjects which were not controlled by the photographer:
- Intermediate angles of photograph
- Different body parts at different angles (ideally) (2-FILTER-3)
4. Determine what orientations are appropriate for subject parts other than whole organism. (3-MEASURE-4)

## Best practice guides

2. Guidance for taking standardized images in the field. (5-KEYS-2)
1. Best practice guide for controlling specimen position to obtain standardized image orientation. (3-MEASURE-1)
2. Best practice guides for certain groups should suggest viewing angles and subject parts that illustrate the features most important for taxonomic identification. (8-ORIENT-2)
