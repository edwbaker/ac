# 3D Imagery and Data Task Group (3DTG)

This is the homepage of the 3D Imagery and Data Task Group chartered by the Audubon Core Maintenance Group.  If you are looking for the Audubon Core Maintenance Group page, it's [here](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/README.md).

The main deliverables in Phase 1 of the group's work will be: property terms for describing Service Access Points of 3D images, controlled vocabulary terms for 3D imaging formats to serve as values for ac:variant, and class terms for 3D imaging modalities to be used as values for ac:subtype.  The main deliverables in Phase 2 will be property terms additions for 3D modality-specific metadata.
